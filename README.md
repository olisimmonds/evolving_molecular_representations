# Evolving Molecular Representations

This work was conducted for a research project for my MSc in Artificial 
Intelligence. This work received a grade of  78%. The code was run on the
University of Southampton's supercomputer Iridis. Due to the nature of 
evolutionary algorithms, it is unfeasible to run the code files with 
standard compute. Please see [Simmonds_dissertation_full](https://github.com/olisimmonds/evolving_molecular_representations/blob/7312e24736c297eb4dc10e770eb6345169beec52/Simmonds_dissertation_full.pdf) for methods and
results. See the abstract from this project below.

The molecule representation problem entails encoding a moleculeâ€™s in
formation as concisely as possible while preserving its key details in a
format that a machine learning model can interpret and use to predict
molecular features. Being able to effectively predict features of a molecule
can aid in drug discovery making the task of improving molecule repre
sentation methods an important one. This paper presents a novel tech
nique to do this, using evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks which
produce representations. This work shows that such a method can be ef
fective with the model presented being the best-performing representation
method out of the methods tested for some regression tasks. This paper
then encourages future work to tune this novel approach so that it can be
improved and become a strong performing method for a larger variety of
tasks.
